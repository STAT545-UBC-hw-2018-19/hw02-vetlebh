```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

##Smell test the data

Firstly, we will look at the dataset as a whole, and try to figure out the format of the dataset. 

```{r}
typeof(gapminder)
class(gapminder)
ncol(gapminder)
nrow(gapminder)
summary(gapminder)
str(gapminder)
```

We see that R regards gapminder as a list by the `typeof`, while the class function reveals that in an object oriented way, gapminder is also a dataframe object.
